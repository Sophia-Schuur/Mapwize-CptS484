# Mapwize-CptS484
Android app to aid the blind in navigating the interior world.

### Install
Download the repo. Open the project in Android Studio. Run. Currently runs with Android Studio 3.5.2.

You may have to fiddle with some settings ("Extended controls" - three dots icon at the bottom next to the phone) once the app is running. Change around the Microphone settings if having trouble with the app hearing you.

### Use
Click INPUT ROOM from the main menu to tell the app which room you want to navigate to. Try saying "10".

Return to the main menu and click NAVIGATE. The app will display where to go beginning from the front door.

Click SETTINGS to define an emergency contact number the app will use when you click CALL EMERGENCY NUMBER.

The process of adding new maps and rooms is completely manual and currently available technology is limited.
To do this, you'd need to log into Mapwize and edit maps and rooms manually. Demo login credentials are unavailable at this time.

### Developer Notes
More information about this app can be found in the many documents in this repo.
